This project was just a simple game of snake made in High School
You can either run the executable inside the application folder, or compile it yourself using Processing.

The game has 3 stages, first one is pretty easy, but the difficulty rises pretty quickly in the other 2 stages.

Man it has been 4 years since i made it, i still havn't completed the game...
